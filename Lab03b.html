                                Nairobi was founded during the British colonial era as a settlement during the construction of a railway line in the 
                                area. It became the main location for keeping military supplies and eventually gained popularity due to its location and 
                                steady rise in merchants, settlers and government officials. In the 1950's Nairobi became a central city for anti-colonial activism 
                                and played a significant role in the Mau Mau Uprising (rebellion against british rule).
